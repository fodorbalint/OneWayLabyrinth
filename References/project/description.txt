Generate a line that goes through an n x n grid (where n is a natural number), passing through each field once. The line has to start from the field at the upper left corner (1 x 1) and end at n x n. At any time it is allowed to move left, right, up or down, and it has to randomly choose between the available fields.
Output the image in svg format.
n = 5.
